# java2_wordsGame

This project consists of a lot of new things like serialization, socket communication, RMI, JNDI, DOM etc. The goal was to create a game in which we have to use all the aforementioned principles.

I created Words Game, similar to Slagalica, in which are 2 opponents trying to find the longer word from the given letters. After 1 round they can communicate through chat and view the replay of their moves in this round.

In demo folder you can find video demonstration.
